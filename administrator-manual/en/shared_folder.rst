Shared folders
==============

A *shared folder* is a place where files can be accessed by a group of
people using Samba (SMB/CIFS).

To create, edit and delete a shared folder go to the :guilabel:`Shared folders`
page.

Authorizations
==============

If **Active directory** is selected as account provider, a shared folder is
owned by a group of users (:guilabel:`Owning group`). Each member of the group
is allowed to read the folder contents. Optionally the group can be entitled to
modify the folder contents and the read permission can be extended to everyone
accessing the system.  This simple permission model is based on the traditional
UNIX file system permissions. 

Access privileges can be refined further with the :guilabel:`ACL` tab, allowing
individual users and other groups to gain read and write permissions.

At any time, the :guilabel:`Reset permissions` button propagates the shared
folder UNIX permissions and Posix ACLs to its contents.

.. warning: 

  Compatible SMB clients can be used to set special ACLs on a specific file or
  sub-directory only if the File server is configured with Kerberos authentication.

If :guilabel:`Guest access` is enabled, any provided authentication
credentials are considered valid.

If an **LDAP** account provider is selected or there is no account provider at
all, any access to shared folders is considered as *Guest access* so that
everyone is allowed to read and write its content. 

.. _smb-access-section:

Network access
==============

SMB/CIFS is a widely adopted protocol that allows to share files
across a computer network. The shared folder name becomes the SMB "share name".

For instance, the SMB network addresses of the ``docs`` share could be ::

   \\192.168.1.1\docs
   \\MYSERVER\docs

.. warning::

  Authenticated access to shared folders is available with an Active Directory
  accounts provider. LDAP provider allows guest access only.

When accessing a SMB share, some user interfaces provide a single user name
field. In that case, specify the **user short name** prefixed with the **NetBIOS
domain name**.  For instance, if the NetBIOS domain name is "DOMAIN" and the
user name is "john.smith", the domain-prefixed user name to access a SMB share
is: ::

    DOMAIN\john.smith

On the contrary, some applications provide separate input fields for the NetBIOS
domain name and the user name; in that case fill in the input fields
individually.

Network recycle bin
===================

If the option :guilabel:`Network recycle bin` is enabled, removed
files are actually moved into a special "wastebasket" directory. The
:guilabel:`Keep copies of files with the same name` keeps distinct file names inside
the wastebasket directory, preventing overwrites.

Hide a shared folder
====================

If :guilabel:`Browseable` is enabled, the shared folder is listed publicly. 
This does not affect the permission to use this resource.


Home share
==========

Each |product| user has a personal shared folder that is mapped to his Unix home
directory. The SMB share name correspond to the **user short name**. For example:

* user short name ``john.smith``
* server name ``MYSERVER``
* server address ``192.168.1.2``

The SMB network address is: ::

 \\MYSERVER\john.smith
 \\192.168.1.2\john.smith

Provide John's credentials as explained in :ref:`smb-access-section`.

.. tip::

    The Unix home directory is created the first time the user accesses it by
    either SMB or SFTP/SSH protocol.
